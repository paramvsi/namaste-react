#Notes

-- Config Driven UI -- Based on location or any other config we can send different data. So UI is data driven.
-- Why we use key in react -- ?? when we loop over childrens in list or when component are in same tree level, 
   react optimises it render cycles, whenever a new key comes in, react dom will insert that key in its place. 
   If there is no key, react will render all component in same level.
