#Notes
================================================================

1. We can create custom hooks like normal JS functions.
2. We have to do proper bundling of the app so that we can help reduce the load time of js files. This process is called
chunking or code splitting or lazy loading or dynamic bundling.
3. const varName = lazy(() => import("./module-to-import.js")); // lazy loading
4. Read lazy loading in react documentation.
